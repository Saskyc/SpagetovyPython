The game will be RPG console game.
Will have hometown and exploration. Procedural generation of "Open" world would be great.
- Mainly procedural dungeon.
- Use files of game to save it and restore.
RPG fights will be based on writing word and by that hurting monster.
- In shops buy "stronger" words that take longer to write.
- Every mistake of writing word takes percentage of attack away.
  - The percentage should be calculated based on the word lenght.
Any dimension should be procedurally generated as maze where you can find each location.
- Overworld:
  - Should have places like shops, dungeons etc.
  - Dungeons are not needed to enter.
